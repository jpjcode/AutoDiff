This is failed attempt to make an autodiffrientaiton library using C#. I am going to be honest I dont like it since it isn't efficient and is not really useable for Machine learning or anything complicated. It is more of a proof of concept to practice learning. I might as well make it public since the next time I will be making one it won't be using this method. There is a lot of spaghetti code and it is disgusting.
