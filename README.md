This is an attempt to make an autodiffrientaiton library using C#. If am going to be honest I dont like it that much, since it isn't as efficient and is not really useable for Machine learning or anything complicated. It is more of a proof of concept to practice learning. I might as well make it public since the next time I will be making one it won't be using this method.
